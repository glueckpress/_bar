Update your site’s core language setting in WordPress via toolbar (aka admin bar).

![Update Site Language Option via Admin Bar](https://github.com/glueckpress/_bar/raw/master/modules/site-language/screenshot.gif)

## Description
**This is not a plugin for multilingual WordPress, translating content and the like!**

In order to switch your site’s language, you would usually need to navigate to _wp-admin/option-general.php_ and pick one of your previously installed translations (or a new one even) from the dropdown menu _Site Language_. When saving your selection, the page would reload and you would see your WordPress admin in said language.

This plugin simply provides a shortcut for all of the above.

After having activated the plugin, you’ll see a new menu item _Site Language_ in your admin bar. Its submenu will list all core translations you have previously installed. (It will not offer you the option to install a new one.)

**Clicking on a language link will update the site language option and reload the current page. Voilá, site language updated!** :boom:

### Languages
* English (en\_US) _(default)_
* German (de_DE)
* German formal (de\_DE_formal)

## Installation
* If you don’t know how to install a plugin for WordPress, [here’s how](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).
* You might want to check the folder name after you downloaded and unzipped the ZIP file. GitHub appends suffixes to the actual folder name; you should always edit it to be equal to this repository’s name before uploading to WordPress.
