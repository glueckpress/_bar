Update your site’s core language setting in WordPress via toolbar (aka admin bar).

![Update Site Language Option via Admin Bar](https://github.com/glueckpress/_bar/raw/master/modules/site-language/screenshot.gif)

## Description
**This is not a plugin for multilingual WordPress, translating content and the like!**

In order to switch your site’s language, you would usually need to navigate to _Settings → General_ and pick one of your previously installed translations (or a new one even) from the dropdown menu _Site Language_. After saving your selection, the page would reload and you would see your WordPress back-end UI (and front-end if translations available for your active theme) in said language.

Particularly when working on a translated plugin or theme UI copy navigating to the _General Settings_ page and switch the site language all the time in order to check whether translated strings are correct can become pretty annoying.

This plugin simply provides a shortcut for all of the above.

After having activated the plugin, you’ll see a new menu item _Site Language_ in your admin bar. Its submenu will list all core translations you have previously installed. (It will not offer you the option to install a new one.)

**Clicking on a language link will update the site language option and reload the current page. Voilá, site language updated!** :boom:
